Hi!

I write, code and do research on economic/financial topics of interest, including, but not limited to: game theory, ML in financial time series, crypto economies, MMO and game economies. I hang around [r/ethfinance](http://reddit.com/r/ethfinance) and/or [r/wallstreetbets](http://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets).
Hmu if you feel like our interests match, always happy to meet collaborators!
I also like photography and surrealist/ trippy images, link to my behance project appreciations and unsplash profile.


#You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your #picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

#Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

#Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
